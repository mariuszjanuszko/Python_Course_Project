# 💼 Data Analyst Job Market Analysis – Italy

This project analyzes the **Italian data analyst job market**, exploring **skill demand, salaries, and optimal skills** for career growth.  
It adapts the methodology taught in **Luke Barousse’s Python & Data Analytics course** to a country-specific context.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

The analysis answers key questions:

1. Which skills are most in-demand for data roles in Italy?  
2. How do skill trends evolve over time for Data Analysts?  
3. How do salaries vary by role and skill?  
4. Which skills are most “optimal” — high-demand **and** high-paying?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Core programming language  
  - **pandas** – Data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation  
  - **matplotlib & seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Analysis and documentation  
- **Visual Studio Code** – Development environment  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and sharing  

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation

- Imported and cleaned dataset provided via Luke Barousse’s course  
- Converted dates, parsed skill lists, and handled missing data  
- Filtered for **Italian job postings** to focus analysis  
- Ensured clean input for all notebooks

## 📊 Analysis Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (`1_EDA_Intro.ipynb`)
- Examined dataset structure and key columns: job titles, locations, salaries, skills  
- Visualized distributions and patterns for initial understanding  
- Identified data cleaning requirements and prepared dataset for deeper analysis  

### 2. Skill Demand (`2_Skill_Demand.ipynb`)
- Identified the most requested skills across top data roles  
- Core skills: SQL, Python, Excel  
- Role-specific tools: Tableau, Power BI, AWS  

### 3. Skill Trends (`3_Skills_Trend.ipynb`)
- Tracked skill demand over time for Data Analysts  
- SQL and Python remain consistently in demand  
- Excel and visualization tools show seasonal or emerging trends  

### 4. Salary Analysis (`4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb`)
- Explored salary distributions by role and skill  
- Senior and specialized roles command higher salaries  
- Core skills are widely demanded but often lower-paying  

### 5. Optimal Skills (`5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb`)
- Combined skill demand and salary to identify high-value skills  
- Python, Tableau, SQL Server offer strong balance of demand and pay  
- Specialized database skills (Oracle, SQL Server) offer high salaries despite lower posting frequency

## 📌 Key Insights

- Core skills like SQL, Python, and Excel are essential for employability  
- Specialized skills increase earning potential  
- Optimal career growth comes from combining widely demanded skills with high-paying specialized skills  
- The data job market is dynamic — continuous learning is essential

## ⚠️ Challenges

- Cleaning and standardizing real-world job posting data  
- Designing clear, insightful visualizations  
- Balancing breadth (overview of market) and depth (specific skill analysis)  
- Adapting a course framework to a country-specific dataset  

---

## 💡What I Learned

- Advanced **Python & pandas** techniques for real-world data  
- Effective **data cleaning and preprocessing**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns  
- Visualizing trends and distributions with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- Translating a course framework to a new market  
- Communicating findings clearly through notebooks
