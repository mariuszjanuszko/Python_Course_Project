# Python Course Project – Job Market Analysis (Italy)

This repository contains my work completed as part of **Luke Barousse’s Python & Data Analytics course**.  
All materials follow the structure of the course, including **basic lessons, advanced lessons, solutions, and the final project**.

The final project was completed **alongside Luke Barousse**, with one key difference:

➡️ **My analysis focuses on the Italian job market**, while Luke’s original project analyzed the U.S. job market.

This repository is intended for **learning, practice, and portfolio demonstration purposes**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of the final project is to analyze the data job market using Python and real-world job posting data.

The analysis answers questions such as:

1. **Which skills are most in demand?**  
   (`2_Skill_Demand.ipynb`)  
   Identify the most frequently requested skills across data-related roles.

2. **How does skill demand change over time?**  
   (`3_Skills_Trend.ipynb`)  
   Analyze trends in skill demand to identify growing or declining skills.

3. **What does the salary landscape look like?**  
   (`4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb`)  
   Explore salary distributions across roles and skills.

4. **Which skills are optimal to learn?**  
   (`5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb`)  
   Combine skill demand and salary insights to identify high-value skills.

The **analysis structure and methodology follow Luke Barousse’s course**, while the **data and insights are specific to the Italian job market**.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project and Luke Barousse’s course, I strengthened both my **Python** and **data analysis** skills, including:

- Writing clean and readable Python code for data analysis
- Using **pandas** to clean, transform, and explore real-world datasets
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Grouping, aggregating, and reshaping data to answer specific questions
- Creating meaningful visualizations with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Analyzing trends over time
- Working with salary data, distributions, and outliers
- Combining multiple metrics (skill demand + salary) to evaluate “optimal” skills
- Structuring a multi-notebook data analysis project
- Adapting an existing analysis framework to a **different job market (Italy vs. U.S.)**

This project helped bridge the gap between **learning Python concepts** and **applying them to a realistic data analytics scenario**.
