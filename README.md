# 🐍 Python Course Project – Full Repository

This repository contains my work completed as part of **Luke Barousse’s Python & Data Analytics course**.  
It includes notebooks for **basic Python, advanced Python/data analysis**, and a **final project** analyzing the Italian data job market.

The final project adapts Luke Barousse’s methodology to a real-world scenario focused on **Italy**, while the course itself provides a structured path from basics to advanced data analytics.
